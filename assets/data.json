            "image": "images/image8.png",
            "Description": " NodeJS is a rapidly growing web server technology, and Node developers are among the highest paid in the industry. Knowing NodeJS well will get you a job or improve your current one by enabling you to build high quality, robust web applications.\n\nIn this course you will gain a deep understanding of Node, learn how NodeJS works under the hood, and how that knowledge helps you avoid common pitfalls and drastically improve your ability to debug problems.\n\nIn this course we'll look at how the C++ written V8 Javascript engine works and how NodeJS uses it to expand the abilities of Javascript. You'll learn how to structure your code for reuse and to be easier to understand, manage, and expand using modules and understand how modules really work.\n\nYou'll learn how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop, as well as how to use the event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files. We'll see how that leads to building a web server in Node.\n\nWe'll dive into web sites, web apps and APIs with Express and learn how Express can save us time as Node developers.\n\nYou'll also gain an understanding of npm, connecting to databases, and the MEAN stack!\n\nDuring it all you'll gain a deep understanding of the Javascript concepts and other computer science concepts that power Node.\n\nNodeJS doesn't have to be hard to learn. The biggest mistake most coding tutorials make is expecting someone to learn simply by imitating others' code. Real world situations are never exactly like the tutorial.\n\nI believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand NodeJS.\n\nNote: In this course you'll also get downloadable source code. You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to.\n"

Flutter is a SDK providing the tooling to compile Dart code into native code and it also gives you a rich set of pre-built and pre-styled UI elements (so called widgets) which you can use to compose your user interfaces.\nFlutter is extremely trending and gets used for major Google apps like their Adwords app - it's now marked as \"ready for production\", hence now is the time to jump in and learn it!\nThis course will teach Flutter & Dart from scratch, NO prior knowledge of either of the two is required! And you certainly don't need any Android or iOS development experience since the whole idea behind Flutter is to only learn one language.\nYou'll learn Flutter not only in theory but we'll build a complete, realistic app throughout this course. This app will feature both all the core basics as well as advanced features like using Google Maps, the device camera, adding animations and more!\nWith Flutter, you'll be able to write code only once and ship your apps both to the Apple AppStore and Google Play.\nUse Google's Material Design to build beautiful, yet fully customizable, apps in no time with almost zero effort. You can use the rich widget suite Flutter provides to add common UI elements like buttons, switches, forms, toolbars, lists and more - or you simply build your own widgets - Flutter makes that a breeze, too.\nHere's what's included in the course:\nDetailed setup instructions for both macOS and Windows\nA thorough introduction to Flutter, Dart and the concept behind widgets\nAn overview of the built-in widgets and how you may add your own ones\nDebugging tipps & tricks\nPage navigation with tabs, side drawers and stack-based navigation\nState management solutions\nHandling and validating user input\nConnecting your Flutter app to backend servers by sending Http requests\nUser authentication\nAdding Google Maps\nUsing native device features like the camera\nAdding beautiful animations & page transitions\nImage Upload\nPush Notifications - manual approach and automated\nHow to publish your app to the app stores\nAnd more!\n"
